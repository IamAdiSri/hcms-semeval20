This repository holds the code that accompanies our system description paper of the same name as the title.

## Task Description

The task description and the accompanying data can be found [here](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20654).

## Paper Abstract

Problems involving code-mixed language are often plagued by a lack of resources and an absence of materials to perform sophisticated transfer learning with. In this paper we describe our submission to the Sentimix Hindi-English task involving sentiment classification of code-mixed texts, and with an F1 score of 67.1\% (which we further improve upon), we demonstrate that simple convolution and attention may well produce reasonable results.

## Requirements

The code has been written in `Python 3.6.0`. Other requirements have been listed in `requirements.txt`.
